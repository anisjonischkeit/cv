          <h4>Senior Software Engineer - App Platform Team (Contract)</h4>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        While at Origin I worked on a wide variety of projects all across our stack.
        Our team's purpose was to find where we can impact multiple teams, or a large
        chunk of the site in order to meaningfully increase productivity, remove recurring
        overhead, unify the customer experience, improve performance, manage the interactions
        between the website (served in a webview) and the native app and guide the front-end
        technical direction of the company. I also worked on a handfull of customer facing 
        projects, which allowed me to actually experience the impact of my work on end users. 
        Some key projects I worked on include:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
        I designed and am currently leading the implementation of a major site-wide performance and UX uplift, leveraging client side routing, bundle and
        data pre-loading, optimistic and stale UIs and caching that
        we estimate will more than half our average page load times on
        our highest trafficked and slowest pages. It also opens a pathway to React 19 and allows us to do a step
        change from our current systems, keeping our microfrontend architecture, automating large parts of the migration and delivering incremental benefits.
      </li>
        <li>
          I lead Origin's adoption of Storybook as well as Interaction and Accesibility 
          Testing to enable more robust testing with less overhead, higher confidence,
          and faster feedback loops.
        </li>
        <li>
          I lead the effort to uplift Origin's Core Frontend Platform to the latest
          versions of core frontend dependencies like React, Material UI and Webpack.
          This included updating our runtime platform to support incremental updates
          of parts of the site and managed and supported the rollout of these changes
          across the organisation.
        </li>
        <li>
          I uplifted Origin's Design System (150+ Component) to the latest
          Material UI, TypeScript, Styled Components, Babel, etc, with 0 UI
          regressions, simplifying the build and development process, and
          rallying together a core group of contributers to get some life,
          pride, and momentum back into this central but neglected project. I
          took it from 0 commits in the previous 6 months to getting multiple
          contributions from across the company merged to master every week.
        </li>
        <li>
          I created Origin's solution for embedding content blocks from wordpress
          into React frontends allowing content authors to reuse existing systems 
          and make content changes in react apps, without developer effort
        </li>
        <!--
        <li>
          Proposed solutions for setting up the future of Origin's frontend platform,
          leveraging my breadth of knowledge on our internal technologies to find
          solutions that we can move to without major effort from dev teams and while
          delivering incremental value along the way. 
        </li>
-->
        <li>I lead the design system team to update and rollout a major brand refresh project</li>
        <li>I uplifted CI pipelines enabling faster feedback loops with issues detected earlier</li> 
        <li>I built Core experiences like Search and the Home Page</li>
        <li>I built a Pre Render service to improve SEO and allow for site auditability over time</li>
        <li>I setup monitoring for frontends to get an indication of and monitor which
          experiences needed to be improved</li>
        <li>
          Setup a Backstage instance to pull together our tooling and documentation 
          into one place and allow a user to view ownership and application's risk
          profiles, deployment history and other useful information.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
      <ul class="threeColList">
        <li>Javascript, Typescript, Node, Bash, Java, PHP, Groovy</li>
        <li>React, Material UI, Styled Components, React Router 7 (Remix)</li>
        <li>Webpack, Babel, Vite, CoreJS</li>
        <li>Storybook, Playwright, Puppeteer, Axe, Jest, Applitools, Chromatic</li>
        <li>Backstage</li>
        <li>Nginx, Docker, Compose, ECS</li>
        <li>Microfrontend Architectures</li>
        <li>Jenkins CI Pipelines</li>
        <li>New Relic</li>
        <li>AWS (CloudFront, S3, CloudFormation, Lambda)</li>
      </ul>

<!--
        <li>
          I added support to allow developers and testers to point at any CI
          build of a site and have that build served to them. This was a simple
          solution that has alleviated the issue of not having enough live
          environments to test on.
        </li>
        <li>
          I Built a Pre-render service to render static html from client side
          rendered react apps to help with SEO on apps that were not able to be
          SSR. This solution was later re-used to feed content from our site to
          our search, and to populate an audit trail for the site.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Another way in which I empowered the development teams is by taking on
        the mammoth task of taking our existing microfrontend architecture and
        our internal libraries (which hadn't dealt with updating shared
        dependencies and the web of missmatched verstions that it creates) and
        working out and executing a plan to facilitate incrementally updating
        microfrontends. This work included:
      </p>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p>
        None of this work could be done without the platform team's house also
        being in order. As such I also spent significant effort in solving the
        issues that stopped our team from rapidly delivering. This was achieved
        by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Majorly simplifying the setup of our frontend platform (TAL) so that
          it is now possible to run TAL locally, pointing at resources from
          either a live or local environment, leading to rapid iteration as we
          could now hot reload the platform, point it at actual live sites and
          validate how changes take effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leaning on existing tooling where people in the past had built
          in-house solutions. Some of these solutions were necessary in the
          past, and others came out of taking on more responsibility than the
          size of the team allowed. Often times, with enough time and
          understanding of the requirements, large chunks of our system could
          just be removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Building tooling to allow searching and bulk raising PRs across
          BitBucket and Github so when we needed to understand things or make
          bulk updates across repos, we could easily do so
        </li>
        <li>
          Running experiments and building POCs on different approaches to
          leverage our existing architecture to achieve things that were thought
          by many to be impossible without large re-writes
        </li>
      </ul>
      -->

      <!--
      <p>
        The existing microfront architecture had gotten stuck due to shared
        dependency issues and this was an issue that was ign cognitive overhead
        during development that were previously not possible a bunch of mission
        critical projects had been left to rot, and I would go into these
        projects, figure out what the issues where and why people didn't want to
        work on them (or felt like they couldn't). I would then create a plan
        and fix these issues, identify the people with a passion for the kind of
        work along the way and upskill and guide them so they could take over
        the project as I move on
      </p>

      <h3>Technological Achievemnts</h3>
      <p>
        During My time at Origin Energy, I took a number of highly impactful
        projects from ideation through to completion. From bringing our design
        system back from a state of abandonware to an active project with
        multiple contributers across the organisation, to working out upgrade
        pathways for our micro-frontend architecture and the ~100 apps that run
        within it and guiding the different teams through these processes. I was
        the subject matter expert in multiple domains and a key driver in
        pushing the organisation into adopting technologies and processes
        applicable to the organisation's size and culture, emphasizing
        simplicity of development and user delight
      </p>
      <p>
        My work at Origin consisted primarily of research into solutions for
        problems without obvious solutions, building proof of concepts, and then
        creating a plan and adoption strategy and then implementing or guiding
        the implementation of these solutions. In previous jobs I also did a lot
        of product work, so I understand the issues that slow down and frustrate
        developers, and I'm passionate about solving these with solutions guided
        by customer experiences
      </p>

      <h3>Business Achievements</h3>
      <p>
        While at Origin I took on the task of updating our Design System to the
        latest versions of its dependencies, and the platform to support
        incrementally updating microsites within it. This project had many
        challenges that were thought to be impossible and I had a lot of
        resistance to undertaking this work as it was thought to be unachievable
        and we could just keep doing what we are doing now. Despite this, I saw
        how important this work was and pushed hard to let the project go
        through. I put together proofs of my approach and created a strategy for
        the upgrade plan. As the project was coming to completion the first team
        came up against blockers in their project that meant they couldn't run
        on the old tech, and felt there was no choice but to opt out of our
        platform and design system. Due to my work they could continue to stay
        on the same platform as everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        6 months later a large amount of teams have updated their app to the
        latest tools without issues and there is now a major UI and APP uplift
        project that can take place within the existing system. The UI uplift
        will mean that we build a massive amount of new components, and without
        my work, we would have had to make a choice of whether we write these
        components using now unsupported technology, whether we take on the UI
        upgrade now (which no-one thought was possible), or whether we throw out
        the old system and start again. My work has saved months of time towards
        these uplift projects, stopped projects from splitting out into their
        own ecosystems, and proven that we can uplift and iterate on our systems
        rather than constantly re-writing things. It's brought rapid iteration
        back to the project and opened oportunities for building user
        experiences that were not possible prior.
      </p>
      <h3>Leadership and Culture Achievements</h3>
      <p>
        When I was at News UK, I started as a Senior Developer and quickly
        became the lead of my squad. This Leadership experience was more of a
        traditional team/tech lead role, where I would liase with the other
        teams/leads to be able to integrate what we work on with what the other
        teams worked on.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Origin my leadership was far less formalised. I had the trust from my
        manager and the team to do a lot more movement between teams and
        projects. A bunch of mission critical projects had been left to rot, and
        I would go into these projects, figure out what the issues where in the
        projects and why people didn't want to work on them (or felt like they
        couldn't). I would then create a plan and fix these issues up until
        people could again see a future and get excited about the project. As
        momentum comes back into the project, I would be looking for and guiding
        a suitable leader to replace me, so I could step back and take on more
        of an advisory role where needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having had my hands on nearly every part of Origin's codebase, I am now
        regularily asked for guidance on all sorts of projects with half of my
        time spent in an advisory capacity
