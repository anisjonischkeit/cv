      <h2>Personal Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Software Engineer with a keen interested and curiosity for all
        things computing. While my specialisation is in Web Technologies, the 
        breadth of my experience allows me to both take full advantage of what 
        browsers are capable of, as well as building the complimentary systems/tooling
        to handle what browsers alone can't.

      <p>
        Throughout my time at Origin I worked on just about every aspect of the frontend.
        I was one of two developers that worked full time on the Frontend Platform
        and Tooling for Origin's React ecosystem. The Goal of the platform team is
        to identify and handle common and shared functionality for our frontends. This
        Includes managing the synergy between the different React apps, the mobile app,
        Wordpress pages, making it all feel as if it's "a single experience".
        Below are some projects I worked on while there:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I setup infrastructure and pathways to allow upgrading Origin's core React
          dependencies across all microsites. Microsites had been forced to run on old 
          versions of React/Material UI/Styled Components/Webpack/etc, some that were up to
          5 years outdated prior to me taking on this project. Since the platform ran multiple React
          apps on the same page, it externalises certain dependancies as having two versions
          often caused issues. My work allowed for multiple versions of these core dependencies
          to run in harmony with one another and was the crucial step in enabling upgrade 
          pathways for our microsites.  
        </li>
        <li>
          I ran experiments and implemented a solution to allow seemlessly
          embedding wordpress UIs (authored by content people) into react apps
        </li>
        <li>
          I built out a proof of concept for a generic approach to cross page
          client side routing, pre-fetching, and client side ahead of time
          rendering, to make the site "feel" like a native app, and to
          overcome speed issues in upstream providers' services.
        </li>
        <li>
          I built a pre-rendering service for SEO bots to be able to get more
          information out of client side rendered applications
        </li>
        <li>
          I uplifted the Origin Design System (Component Library) to the latest
          dependencies and provided a migration path that allowed for most
          microsites to upgrade with very little effort. The library contains
          around 150 reusable UI components and with a PR contained 450 file
          changes I managed to update dependencies that were between 2 and 5
          years outdate while causing almost 0 visual regression.
        </li>
        <li>
          I Built out a Backstage services that allows for a single entrypoint
          into all of our projects. This includes building and hosting
          documentation, deployment history of apps, ownership of repositories,
          dependency graphs of apps/repos/libraries, monitoring and more
        </li>
        <li>Implemented custom UIs from designs for the new homepage and search experience</li>
      </ul>
