      <h2>Personal Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Software Engineer with a keen interested and curiosity for all
        things computing. While my specialisation is in Web Technologies, the 
        breadth of my experience allows me to both take full advantage of what 
        browsers are capable of, as well as building the complimentary systems/
        tooling to handle what browsers alone can't.

      </div>
      <p>
        Throughout my time at Origin I worked on just about every aspect of the frontend.
        I was one of two developers that worked full time on the Frontend Platform
        and Tooling for Origin's React ecosystem. The Goal of the platform team is
        to identify and handle common and shared functionality for our frontends. This
        Includes managing the synergy between the different React apps, the mobile app,
        Wordpress pages, making it all feel as if it's "a single experience".
        Below are some projects I worked on while there:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I setup infrastructure and pathways to allow upgrading Origin's core React
          dependencies across all microsites. Microsites had been forced to run on old 
          versions of React/Material UI/Styled Components/Webpack/etc, some that were up to
          5 years outdated prior to me taking on this project. Since the platform ran multiple React
          apps on the same page, it externalises certain dependancies as having two versions
          often caused issues. My work allowed for multiple versions of these core dependencies
          to run in harmony and was the crucial step in enabling upgrade pathways for our microsites.  
        </li>
        <li>
          I ran experiments and implemented a solution to allow seemlessly
          embedding wordpress UIs (authored by content people) into react apps
        </li>
        <li>
          I built out a proof of concept for a generic approach to cross page
          client side routing, pre-fetching, and client side ahead of time
          rendering to make the site "feel" like a native app, and to
          overcome speed issues in upstream providers' services. Learnings from
          this POC have heavily influenced the technical direction for the development
          of Origin's new Mobile Application
        </li>
        <li>
          I built a pre-rendering service for SEO bots to be able to get more
          information out of client side rendered applications. This service was later
          also leveraged to feed more data into our Search Experience
        </li>
        <li>
          I uplifted the Origin Design System (Component Library) to the latest
          major dependencies (MUI, React, Typescript, Babel, etc) and provided a 
          migration path that allows most microsites to upgrade with very little 
          effort. The library is used by over 100 apps, contains
          around 150 reusable UI components that were 2 - 5
          years outdated, and was updated with almost 0 visual regression. The project 
          has brought new life, excitement and momentum to our Design System, and a wave 
          of optimism around our ability to iterate on it. 
        </li>
        <li>
          I Built out a Backstage services that allows for a single entrypoint
          into all of our projects. This includes aggregating, building and hosting our applications'
          documentation, deployment history, ownership, security risk profile, routing information, 
          dependency graphs, monitoring and more
        </li>
        <li>Implemented custom UIs from designs for the new homepage and search experience</li>
      </ul>
